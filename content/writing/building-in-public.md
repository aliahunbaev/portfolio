I've always been hesitant to share work before it's "ready." There's this voice that says: *wait until it's perfect, wait until you've figured it all out, wait until you won't embarrass yourself.*

But that voice is a liar.

## The Myth of Ready

When I started building my portfolio, I wanted everything polished. Every project case study needed to be complete, every interaction perfect, every word carefully chosen.

The problem? I never actually shipped anything.

I'd redesign the same section five times. I'd write and rewrite copy until it lost all personality. I'd hold off on launching because "just one more thing" wasn't quite right.

## Learning in Public

Here's what I've learned: the work gets better when other people see it.

Not because their feedback is always right (it's not). But because explaining your decisions to someone else forces you to examine them yourself. Defending your choices helps you understand if they're actually defensible.

And sometimes—often, actually—you realize they're not. That's okay. That's the point.

## Vulnerability as Strength

There's something powerful about saying "I'm still figuring this out."

It makes you approachable. It makes your work relatable. It gives others permission to be imperfect too.

The designers I admire most aren't the ones with perfect portfolios. They're the ones who share their process—the messy sketches, the failed experiments, the iterations that didn't work.

## The Practice

So I'm trying something different. Sharing the work while it's still in progress. Publishing essays that aren't perfectly polished. Showing projects that are "good enough" instead of waiting for "perfect."

It's uncomfortable. But discomfort usually means you're growing.

And honestly? The work ships faster. It gets better feedback. And I enjoy the process more.

Maybe that's the real metric of success: not perfection, but sustainable progress.
